# Rocket Launch Predictor

![showcase1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44825996-f0f1-424a-bb52-65bc4861ec75)

## Why?
- We wanted to create a terminal application to give you information on the outcome of rocket lauches.
- Done as a project for a distributed processing class.

## What
- It is a terminal application that trains a machine learning model on rocket launch data.
- It uses a weather api to retrieve weather data and feed it into our random forest model.
- It also uses a space flight api to retrieve upcoming launches.
- From there you can select a launch to see whether our model thinks it will be scrubbed.
